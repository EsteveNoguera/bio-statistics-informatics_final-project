# Final project: EasyOmics

Final project for Master's degree in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics for the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. The main goal is to develop a Shiny R tool that allow wet lab scientits with no prior experience in omics data to get from basic univariate analysis like differential expression of genes or to apply Machine Learning models in order to get relevant biomarkers between control and test groups.
